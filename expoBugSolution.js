The most effective approach is to systematically verify the Android SDK installation. This commonly involves:

1. **Check for Missing Tools:** Ensure that essential Android build tools, such as the build-tools, platform-tools, and the correct Android SDK platform, are installed and correctly configured within the Android SDK Manager.
2. **Verify Environment Variables:** Double-check that the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable points correctly to the root directory of your Android SDK installation, and that the `PATH` variable includes the paths to `$ANDROID_HOME/tools` and `$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools`.
3. **Clean and Rebuild:** Completely clean the project's build cache, by removing the `node_modules` folder and the `android` folder within your project, and then performing a fresh installation of dependencies (using `npm install` or `yarn install`) followed by a full rebuild with `expo prebuild` and `expo build:android`.
4. **SDK Manager Integrity:** Open the Android SDK Manager directly and search for any inconsistencies, outdated packages, or failed installations.  Repair or reinstall any problematic components. 
5. **Check Java Versions:** Confirm Java Development Kit (JDK) is properly set up and the correct version is used (Java 8 or 11 are commonly used). Check for any Java environment inconsistencies.
6. **Gradle Configuration:** Analyze the `android/build.gradle` and `android/app/build.gradle` files to check for any discrepancies in project-level settings, dependencies or plugin versions that might conflict with the Android SDK. 
7. **Antivirus Interference:** Temporarily disable your antivirus software to rule out potential conflicts with the build process. 
8. **Permissions Issues:**  Check if you have the necessary permissions to access and modify the Android SDK directory.

By systematically tackling these points, you should be able to identify the underlying cause of the Android SDK build error and restore successful builds.
